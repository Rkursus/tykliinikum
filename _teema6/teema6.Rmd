This tutorial briefly describes **shiny**, an R package that enables development,
testing and deployment of interactive web applications.

**shiny** is extremely flexible, so you can build an application to help solve almost
any real (or fictitious) quantifiable problem you can think of, interactively.
It's a cliche
worth repeating: with shiny, you really are limited only by your imagination.

Because **shiny** is an open source
project with a user [community](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/shiny-discuss)
and commercial support from RStudio, it has excellent documentation.
This includes a user group, a Gallery of examples and (most recommended of all)
a fantastic up-to-date [online tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) maintained by
[RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/), 
who's software has made life easier for R
beginners and [developers](http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/) alike.
In the latest version or RStudio for example, the autocompletion rules
received an overhaul, allowing (amongst other things)
objects created in `ui.R` to autocomplete in `server.R` in **shiny** apps
(these files are described below in this tutorial).
For these reasons RStudio is recommended as the IDE for this tutorial: 
it even provides a button to auto-save and test **shiny** applications with a single 
click (Figure 1).

# To make an (perhaps unfair) analogy,
# RStudio is to R what Canonical is/was to Linux: a commercial enterprise
# that greatly improved the user-friendliness of the underlying
# program.^[RStudio's impact on R is hard to overstate and it's employees are
# responsible for a number of the most
# [frequently downloaded](http://crantastic.org/popcon) packages
# including [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/),
# [dplyr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html) and [stringr](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2010-2/RJournal_2010-2_Wickham.pdf).
# This tutorial was even written and compiled in RStudio Desktop, with its
# seamless integration with [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) and
# [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). RStudio
# is now sufficiently advanced and stable to be one's default
# text editor for writing [tutorials](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R/), [vignettes](http://robinlovelace.net/r/2014/01/10/spatial-clipping-and-aggregation-in-R.html) and even
# academic papers. RMarkdown's recently added support for 
# [Pandoc citations](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) has enabled it to be used as a fully fledged text
# editor. If I were to write my [thesis](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/5027/) again, I'd probably do it in
# RMarkdown to save all the `\`s needed for pure LateX!.]

```

There is already much high quality material on shiny, so why do we need another
tutorial? This one introduces the wider context and creates a narrative for
the excellent [RStudio tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/).
This tutorial helps navigate this tutorial than trying to 
reproduce it. The aim is simple:
**to navigate beginners through the basics of shiny for creating interactive online visualisations**. 

We will pursue this aim through the course of **3 tasks** that get progressively
harder.

Before
proceeding it's worth taking a look at the following **shiny** resources,
to get a sense of what else is out there:

- RStudio's [**shiny** website](http://shiny.rstudio.com/).
- The **shiny** [github repo](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny).
- Stackexchange [questions about shiny](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=shiny).
- An [academic paper](http://iopscience.iop.org/1755-1315/20/1/012014) outlining the potential of **shiny** in precision farming.
- The [**shiny** cheat sheet](http://shiny.rstudio.com/images/cheatsheet.pdf.zip).

# What **shiny** can (and cannot) do

Before committing to shiny, it's important to think about what you want
to acheive with it.
**shiny** is well suited for:

- Relatively simple visualisations of small datasets that can be processed on an external server.
- 'Proof of concept' demonstrations of the applications that may be scaled-up at a later stage.
- Rapid deployment of interactive applications without having to learn another language
for people who are already proficient with R.

**shiny** is not so good at:

- Serving and processing large datasets (it may be best to pre-calculate results of
complex computations and use **shiny** to visualise them).
- Map serving: this may be best left to something heavier duty like [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/) (although see the [SuperZip](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html) example).
- Collecting user information.

**shiny'**s strengths can be seen in the following examples.

- The [Ebola-Dynamic-Model](https://econometricsbysimulation.shinyapps.io/Ebola-Dynamic-Model/) which provides an interactive model of Ebola infections.
- The 'word cloud' example in RStudio's [gallery](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/word-cloud.html) illustrates the display of qualitative information..
- The 'google-charts' example shows how **shiny** can integrate with existing web
visualisation tools.
- The '[superzip](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html)' example demonstrates R visualisations synchronised with a web map.
- A paper by @Jahanshiri2014 which used **shiny** to create a proof-of-concept
application, for precision farming.

Alternatives to **shiny** are:

- [Google charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) which integrates with R (and shiny) via the **[googleVis](http://cran.r-project.org/package=googleVis)** package
- [Plotly](https://plot.ly/), which has excellent integration with R via the **[plotly](https://plot.ly/r/getting-started/)** package.
- [d3](http://d3js.org/) is an extremely flexible JavaScript visualisation package, which interfaces to R via the [d3Network](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/d3Network/index.html) package.
- [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/) is similar to **shiny** but is more focussed on visualisation and offers fewer options for user input. It can be used in **shiny** apps and as an interface between d3 and other JavaScript plotting libraries.

Having browsed these options (and perhaps others) and deciding that **shiny**
is the tool for the job, it's time to get started.

# Getting started with **shiny**

**shiny** in fact contains a wide range of pre-built apps that can be explored and
modified by the user to see how the system works.

To see what examples are available, use the `runExample()` function:

```{r}
runExample()
```

Based on the results from this, you can proceed. Let's run the widgets example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
runExample("07_widgets")
```

The most informative example for beginners is probably the first:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
runExample("01_hello")
```

Spend some time taking a look at the `ui.R` and `server.R` files. Note that
**every shiny app must contain these two files**, placed in a folder of the
app's name. That's fundamental to the app's structure. The following directory
structure (contained on this project's GitHub page), for example, 
contains two **shiny** apps:

```
|-- hi
|   |-- change-app-lines.R
|   |-- server.R
|   `-- ui.R
|-- rentSplit
|   |-- server.R
|   |-- shinyapps
|   |   `-- robinlovelace
|   |       `-- rentSplit.dcf
|   `-- ui.R
|-- learning-shiny.Rmd
`-- learning-shiny.R

```

The directory structure illustrated above shows a typical R working director
with `shinyapps.R` being the only file in the route directory, 
to run the apps in the sub-folders `hi` and `rentSplit`. These
are apps. Note that both contain critical **ui**and **server** components. 
`rentSplit` contains another sub-directory `shinyapps`, used to embed the app online
on [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io/).

The rentSplit app that we are going to build today is hosted on this website
and available to anyone worldwide, through the following link:
https://robinlovelace.shinyapps.io/rentSplit/

Before building your own app (the next section), it's worth looking at the
contents of the `runExample("01_hello")` app in some detail. We will modify
this example for our own needs.

## Downloading the project repository

To download the folder that contains all the code needed to run the examples
in this tutorial, navigate to the project's repository:
https://github.com/Robinlovelace/learning-shiny

Click on 'Download ZIP' on the right hand side of this page. Unzip the folder.
Navigate into this folder and open the file `learning-shiny.Rproj` in
RStudio. Take a look around and make yourself at home in this folder: it will
be your digital home throughout this tutorial!

# Modifying an app for your own needs

The cornerstone of scientific progress can be summarised in a single phrase
by Isaac Newton: 

> "Building on the shoulders of giants"

This means that instead of starting from scratch every time, sometimes we can 
move forward faster by modifying what someone else has already done, giving
due credit to the original source. This is ethic underlying software allows
open source options such as Linux
and R to triumph over proprietary programs such as Microsoft Windows
and [SAS](http://www.r-bloggers.com/sas-is-1in-plans-to-discontinue-use/).

So let's make a modification to the `01_hello` app, so that the user can *decide*
which colour they want the histogram to be. The end result should look something
like Figure 2.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A modified version of the '01_hello' shiny example - note the dropdown menu to select colour that we have added."}
img <- readPNG(RCurl::getURLContent("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Robinlovelace/robinlovelace.github.io/master/img/shiny-modified-app.png"))
grid.raster(img)
# ![modified](/home/robin/repos/robinlovelace.github.io/img/shiny-modified-app.png)
```

How do we create this? 
First create a new folder and label it with your new app's name
(perhaps called `himod` which mean's 'hello_01 modified') This folder will contain
the new app's code so it runs from the project's root directory.
Next we must identify and edit the two key features of the shiny
app: the *user interface* and the *server side*.

## The user interface (ui.R)

This is probably the best place to start as it's where you define the user's
input into the project. `surver.R` can then be instructed to take the user's
input and base the output on the input (yes, `server.R` creates
a new function with `function(input, output)`!).

We must look past some essential but less interactive elements before getting
to the interactive widgets that can be changed. These usually include:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
shinyUI(fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Hello Shiny!"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
#       ... content here
     )
   )
))
```

We don't need to go into detail about what these are and what they do.
This is explained on RStudio's **shiny** [tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) and **shiny'**s internal documentation system.
Typing `?sidebarLayout`, for example, will display some very useful help!
As [Lesson 2](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson2/) from RStudio's tutorial
explains, `shinyUI(fluidPage( ))` alone will create the display. It is *fluid* because
it automatically adjusts to the width of the user's device.

What we are interested in is how to add additional [widgets](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson3/), a full list of which is presented here: http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson3/ .

To add an option selector widget, we use, logically enough, the `selectInput()`
widget function. The essential arguments are as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
selectInput(inputId = "inputID",
  label = "What the user sees",
  choices = list("list", "of", "options"),
  selected = "default option" )
```

## Task 1a: adding a color selector option

You can add new widgets to the `ui.R` script without affecting the server side.
Do this now to create the drop down menu of color selection illustrated above.

> Hint: Check RStudio's [page on **shiny** widgets](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/lesson3/) (lesson 3 at shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) for a list of available widgets

When you are complete, run the app either by typing `runApp("hi")` or by
clicking on the 'Run App' button in RStudio. Note that when new content is added to 
the user interface side of shiny, it does not necessarily affect the app
(in this case, we can select a colour without any impact on the resulting graph).
To change the output, we need to move to the server side.

## The server side (server.R)

One key argument you should have noticed in the previous section is that all
widgets must have an ID, such as `bins` in the "hi" app that we're working on:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
      sliderInput("bins",
        "Number of bins:",
        min = 1,
        max = 50,
        value = 30)
    ),
```

In the above code chunk there are five arguments, the latter of which
(`min`, `max`, and `value`) are
specific to the slider: `textInput()`, `fileInput()` and the other 10+
widgets will take slightly different arguments. However,
**all widgets require an ID and a label**. These are always the first two
arguments in **shiny** widgets and they must be user-defined *character strings*
(this means text surrounded by quote marks, single `'like this'` or double
`"like this"`). The arguments accepted by `textInput()` and `fileInput()`
widget functions are shown below to illustrate the point: the first
two arguments are essential and remain unchanged for all **shiny** widget functions.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
textInput(inputId = ..., label = ..., value = ...,)
fileInput(inputId = ..., label = ..., multiple = ..., accept = ...)
```

Although we do not need to explicitly state the arguments in our code
(`sliderInput(inputId = "bins", label = "nbins", ...)` is identical to
`sliderInput("bins", "nbins", ...)` because of
[positional matching](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functions.html#function-arguments)
in R functions [@wickham2014adv], it is good practice to state the arguments
explicitly, especially when you are learning new functions and communicating the
code to novices. `inputID` is the first argument in every widget function because
it is the most important: **it is the only link between ui.R and server.R**.

When we look at the code in `server.R` in the "hi" app example, we can see
how the `bins` input object (referred to using its ID, `"bins"`) is called:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
    bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)
```

**Thus, to refer to objects created in ui.R, we must use the following notation**:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
input$inputID
```

Understanding this is critical to completing the next task.

## Task 1b: make the graph's color change by modifying server.R

Based on the above description of the link between `ui.R` and `server.R`,
make the colour selected in the user interface implemented in **task 1a**
be an active input into the graph: make the graph change colour.

When you've completed tasks 1a and 1b, it's time to create a **shiny** app from scratch.
Following the learning by doing ethic, it's recommended that you type the entirety
of the code for this app (comprising of only 2 files, `server.R` and `ui.R`),
rather than copy-and-pasting from the rentSplit example already contained in this
project.

As always, before we jump into writing the code, we should think a little about
the wider context: think more, work less!

# Building RentSplitR

To see how **shiny** works, there is no better way than starting with a *pen and paper*.
That's because your web application should be driven by a clear sense of purpose.
Just learning **shiny** for the hell of it, with no use cases in mind could
be a waste of time: you'll only retain the techniques if you use them frequently
on a project that is worth the time invested. So here's a mock example of the need
for a new app. The need is as follows:

- Many people who share accommodation are not happy with their room/rent.
- It's difficult to judge how to set the rent fairly, based on how good different rooms are.
- Therefore there is a need for an interactive tool to help decide the right rent.

## Task 2: re-create RentSplit to make it your own

Based on the code contained in the rentSplit folder, re-write this app.
Resisting the temptation to copy-and-paste, and referring frequently to
the RStudio [tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) will improve your
understanding. It's likely that error messages will appear the first few times you
try to run the app - this is normal! Persevere and you'll feel a sense of satisfaction
when the app, written entirely by you, finally works.

# Task 3: write your own app

By carefully completing the previous two tasks you should have built-up the
skills needed to build and deploy your own apps. This final task is open ended:
create your own app that meets a real world need.
